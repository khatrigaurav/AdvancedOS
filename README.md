## Function: 
This is a custom library for dynamic memory allocation written in C using **mmap** and **free list** data structure. The library essentially allocates (i.e. malloc) and deallocate (i.e. free) memory segments. The First Fit strategy is used to find the first free memory block.

Project Completed as part of a lab work for Advanced OS, CS 690.
